## Our Target Audience
Working professionals with multiple credit cards

## Problem
Many working professionals own multiple credit cards as each card has different benefits at different retail outlets. In order to maximise savings, they would have to use different credit cards at different outlets, but it can be troublesome to remember which card to use at each retail outlet.

## Our solution: Credit Card Chooser
An app with access to a database of all the different credit card benefits. The user can input the retail outlet they are buying from, and the app will tell the user which credit card to use in order to maximise gains, as well as the exact amount saved compared to other credit cards.

## Assumptions
1. People would want to download an app to save marginal sums of money

2. Those who own multiple credit cards find it difficult to memorise the benefits for each card

## Unique Selling Point
No products like this exist in Singapore

## Competitors
Wallaby - an Application based in the US that allows US citizens to compare credit cards and acts as a pesronal accounting app.

## Limitations
1. The necessity to constantly update the app with the latest credit card details
-can this possibly be done automatically?

2. User still needs to key in location of store and quantity of purchase
-build in location tracking to simplify the process?

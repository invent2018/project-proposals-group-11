## Because snoozing in lectures is for sissies

## Our Target Audience
1. Students in secondary/tertiary institutions with gruelling long school hours and endless tiring lectures

2. Workers in the office having trouble paying attention during meetings

## Problems
1. People often sleep during lectures - 
There is no effective way to get them to focus as if they are sleepy, as they will keep dropping off again and again even if jolted awake by their friends.

2. Disrupting lessons - 
Calling out students who fall asleep is very disruptive to the lessons that the teachers are conducting. Sleeping also shows a lack of respect to the lecturer and causes students to fall behind on their learning.

3. Coffee is not a good solution - 
Studies show that adolescents should not be drinking so much coffee too keep themselves awake as it is detrimental to their health.

## Our solution: A wearable band
Contains a micro-bit with a heart rate and galvanic sensor, that measures your resting heart rate. When the heart rate falls far below the average (indicating sleep) the band will vibrate to wake you up or deliver a small electric shock after a certain amount of time.

## Assumptions
1. Students care enough to stay awake during lectures to pay money for it

2. Students are willing to endure pain to stay awake during lectures

3. Students cannot rely on their fellow classmates to constantly wake them up

## Unique Selling Point
Some products like this exist on the market but they are expensive (more than 100USD) and not catered to students who are broke. Furthermore, they are mostly not readily available in Singapore. Additionally, this is an automated method to wake students up which is highly efficient and saves the effort of the teachers.

## Competitors
STEER - a wearable band that warns drivers who are about to fall asleep at the wheel with a small electric shock. Innovative idea but with a prohibitively high unit cost and unreliable shipping (the company has gone bust as of May 2018)
